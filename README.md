[**Text Analysis with Python**](https://github.com/shreyakabra/NLP-Projects/blob/main/TextAnalysisWithPython.ipynb): Performed text analysis on a dataset of articles, understanding variour NLP topics including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and topic modeling. The code generates a word cloud from article titles, visualizes sentiment distribution with a histogram, and extracts named entities, presenting the most common ones in a bar chart. Additionally, it applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to model the articles into 5 distinct topics, with a bar chart showing the distribution of dominant topics. The analysis leverages interactive visualizations using Plotly to provide insights into text patterns, sentiment, entities, and topics.
