[**Text Analysis with Python**](https://github.com/shreyakabra/NLP-Projects/blob/main/TextAnalysisWithPython.ipynb): Performed text analysis on a dataset of articles, understanding variour NLP topics including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), and topic modeling. The code generates a word cloud from article titles, visualizes sentiment distribution with a histogram, and extracts named entities, presenting the most common ones in a bar chart. Additionally, it applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to model the articles into 5 distinct topics, with a bar chart showing the distribution of dominant topics. The analysis leverages interactive visualizations using Plotly to provide insights into text patterns, sentiment, entities, and topics.

[**Book Blurb Sentiment Analysis**](https://github.com/shreyakabra/NLP-Projects/blob/main/Book_Blurb_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb): This project performs sentiment analysis on a dataset of 10,000 book blurbs using a hybrid pipeline of rule-based labeling (VADER), traditional machine learning (TF-IDF + Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression), and deep learning (LSTM). The blurbs are preprocessed, vectorized, and labeled as positive, neutral, or negative based on compound sentiment scores. A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier achieved an F1-score of 0.84 and accuracy of 83.7%, while logistic regression further improved the F1-score to 0.86. An LSTM model was trained for sentiment score regression, reaching a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.12. The notebook includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to provide a comprehensive sentiment profiling of book descriptions
